# Validation
## Validation and the reject/fix loop

Validator, AddressDoctor and other data quality features allow setting up rigid and shareable (project-wide) rules to validate data. Repeatability of CloverDX transformations encourages an iterative loop of validate->reject->fix->revalidate. This loop can be internal (business users vs IT) or external (customer has to fix the data).
