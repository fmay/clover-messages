## Reducing operating costs by 42% by migrating legacy systems to a new ERP

### A major financial and leasing provider successfully deployed a CloverETL data migration solution to cleanse and consolidate AS/400 and Dynamics NAV legacy systems to ERP, increasing processing speed by one-third and significantly reducing annual operating costs.

Contending with more than 27 million records, the company needed to solve their main issue—the increase in overhead due to managing outdated legacy systems with a large number of duplicate or incorrect records and compatibility issues. Some entries, such as client data, had been included in both systems, necessitating their running simultaneously. This resulted in a slower processing speed and an increase in staff to handle the process. We created a solution to migrate the data to a new SAP ERP system that would replace the two outdated ones.

- Migrated data from disparate legacy systems into an ERP system
- Data quality checks eliminated redundant data and reduced data volume by 25%
- Consolidating legacy systems increased processing speed by one-third
- Modern ERP system reduces the company’s operating costs by 42% annually
