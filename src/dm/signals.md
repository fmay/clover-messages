# Signals and drivers

- Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (Unifying alien worlds and IT stacks under one roof)
- Consolidation of application, reducing complexity of IT stack, house-cleaning
- Modernization (replacing low performing or low feature apps with newer ones)
- Upgrades of application between incompatible versions
- New systems that need some data to start with (usually partial or computed)
- Fundamental process changes calling for redistribution or reformatting of current data
