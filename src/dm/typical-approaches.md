<!-- DM Basics : 2 typical approaches to data migration -->

# 2 Typical Approaches

## Big Bang
### Advantages
- Migration is done all at once
- Less cost (training and managing of parallel systems)
- Less complex (no need for parallel operations)

### Drawbacks
- Higher risk of expensive failure due to unforeseen issues coupled with lack of agile project management and implementation techniques
- Causes downtime so not always possible

## Trickle Migration
### Advantages
- Incremental - zero downtime
- Less prone to costly surprises due to chunking of work and iterative runs

### Drawbacks
- Planning and execution is trickier due to syncing issues
- Management and implementation techniques
- Higher cost due to maintaining multiple live systems, projects overhead and cross-training
